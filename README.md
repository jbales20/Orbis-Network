# Orbis Network

This was coded in HTML and Javascript.
This is designed to convert https://store.playstation.com product links into PS4 and PS3 friendly links that the system can read.
The conversion can be done on either console or on another device, but if not done on a PlayStatino console, the user will be given a shorten link that will
redirect them to the page if they go to it on their console. That is intended for PlayStation messages or ease of use. 

The live websites are
http://orbisconverter.com and http://orbis.click/

As of this moment, I am waiting for my FTP permission to be updated for orbis.click to be used. 
I will be getting the SSL when I can.
