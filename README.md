# Orbis Network

This was coded in HTML and Javascript.
This is designed to convert https://store.playstation.com product links into PS4 and PS3 friendly links that the system can read.
The conversion can be done on either console or on another device, but if not done on a PlayStatino console, the user will be given a shorten link that will
redirect them to the page if they go to it on their console. That is intended for PlayStation messages or ease of use. 

The live websites are
http://orbisconverter.com and http://orbis.click/

As of this moment, I am waiting for my FTP permission to be updated for orbis.click to be used. 
I will be getting the SSL when I can.

# How To Use
If you are on a computer, you would insert your https://store.playstation.com URL into the site, then click convert.
You'd then be given a new link to go to or share with others on your PlayStation console.
Then on your console you'd click the label that says "Click Here" and it will open directly to that game or application's page 
on the console's Standalone Application store.

If you are on a PlayStation console, you would insert your https://store.playstation.com URL and then click convert.
You'd then have a link you can click that will open directly to that game or application's page on the console's Standalone Application store.
